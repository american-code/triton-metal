# Install MLX's prebuilt Metal shader library next to a binary that links
# TritonMetalMLX, so the GPU backend works under plain SwiftPM — on a CI box, on a
# lab node, or on any machine without a working Xcode.
#
# Vendored from Tools/fetch-metallib.sh in mccl, which adapted it in turn from
# SwiftSci (github.com/…/SwiftSci) — the mechanism and the pip-wheel trick are
# SwiftSci's, the version auto-detection and multi-destination handling are
# mccl's. Only the destination comments below are this repository's.
#
# Nothing in triton-metal's core needs this: `libtritonmetal.dylib`, the Python
# shim and `tmbench` have no MLX dependency at all. It is needed by exactly the
# two things that link the MLX frontend — `swift test`'s TritonMetalMLXTests and
# the `tmsae` executable.
#
# Why this exists
# ---------------
# mlx-swift compiles the MLX C++ core, but it does NOT build `mlx.metallib`: that
# shader library is produced by Xcode's build system, and `swift build` never runs
# it. A binary without the metallib links and starts, then throws
# `[metal::Device] Not found: mlx.metallib` the first time it touches the GPU.
#
# The prebuilt, version-matched metallib ships inside the `mlx-metal` pip wheel, so
# we take it from there. MLX's loader looks in the directory of the running binary
# first, which is why DEST_DIR is a build directory and not a system path.
#
# The version MUST match the MLX core bundled by mlx-swift. That is not the
# mlx-swift package version: mlx-swift 0.31.4 bundles MLX core 0.31.1. It is read
# from <checkout>/Source/Cmlx/mlx/mlx/version.h, which this script does for you.
#
# Usage
# -----
#   Tools/fetch-metallib.sh                       # auto-detect version, install into
#                                                 # .build/debug and .build/release
#   Tools/fetch-metallib.sh 0.31.1 .build/release # explicit version and destination
#
# For `swift test`, the xctest bundle runs out of .build/<config>/, so the default
# destinations cover it.
